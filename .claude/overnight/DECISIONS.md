# Decisions log

Autonomous decisions made during the overnight run. Each entry: the fork, ~5 options, the choice, and why.

## 2026-06-12 17:15 — Flavor + objective for the run
Fork: which overnight flavor/objective to run on a prose-sacred essay repo
Options:
1. objective: data-rigor figure audit  2. objective: ref/footnote integrity  3. objective: figure visual QA  4. objective: citation pass  5. dev: PR-shepherding
Chose: 1 — user picked "Data-rigor figure audit"; it fits the project's mandatory data-rigor process, is gate-safe (touches scripts/ + variable-audit.md, not prose), and is high-value since codebook .txt files are now on disk but the audit header is stale.

## 2026-06-12 17:15 — Audit tooling state (informs item 1)
Fork: is the audit already codebook-grounded or does it need wiring?
Finding: extract_codebook_entries.py READS the on-disk codebook .txt (good); generate_variable_audit.py does NOT — it uses a manual KNOWN_ANNOTATIONS dict and a stale "no codebook PDFs are checked in / download the PDF" fallback. Decision: item 1 un-stales the header + fallback message; subsequent items upgrade ❓ vars to codebook-cited annotations using codebook_entries.txt. No prose touched.
